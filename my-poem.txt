there once was a place, i know
where all my data would go
the magical word was 'init'
transported to the land of git

inside grimoires and repositories
notched belts of 'total uploaded'glories
the spiders web,hung morsel, a grub
the keystone of Git Hub

ruba dub dub
now we are all swirling in a 
git induced data collection hubbub
